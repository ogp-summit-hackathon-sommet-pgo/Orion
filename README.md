## Description

A visualization tool to calculate the best usage of rooftop area in urban and suburban areas. The usage can be any combination of Solar cells and 'Green roofing', in terms of area. This tool will also display the amount of power generated.

## Challenge
SDG indicator 11.7.1: Mobilize open data to identify the share of public use of open spaces in cities. What percentage is green space? How often are they used? How much open space is accessible to children? Older persons? Persons with disabilities?

## TO-DO
* Developing a geo-visualziation tool
