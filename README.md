## Description

A visualization tool to identify the roofs that are the best candidates for having solar panels. This is a case study for Toronto, but the same methods could easily be applied to other cities across the globe. The algorithm for determining fit relies on the following factors:
* roof surface area, as estimated from building footprint
* building height -- ideally 4m-20m
* proximity to taller buildings
* annual hours of sunlight
* potential power generation based on above factors vs current power consumption
* whether the building is city-owned

## Challenge
SDG indicator 11.7.1: Mobilize open data to identify the share of public use of open spaces in cities. What percentage is green space? How often are they used? How much open space is accessible to children? Older persons? Persons with disabilities?

## TO-DO
* Developing a geo-visualziation tool
